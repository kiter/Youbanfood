     * I arrived in london at last.
     * The railway station was big black and dark.
     * I did not the way to my hotel,so I asked porter.
     * I not only spoke English very carefully,but very clearly as well.
     * The porter,however,cloud not understand me.
     * I repeated my question several times and at last he understood.
     * He answer me,but he spoke neither slowly or clearly.
     * 'I am foreigner' I said.The he spoke slowly,but I cloud not understand him.
     *
     * My teacher never spoke english like that.
     * The porter and I  looked at each other and smiled.
     * Then he said something and I understood it.
     * 'You soon learn English' he said.I wonder,In England each person speak a different language.
     * The English understand each other,but I don't understand them.
     * Do they speak English.
